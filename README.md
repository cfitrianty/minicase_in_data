# minicase_in_data
This repository is slightly different from previous repositories. Because this is a minicase or pre-test example as a data analyst in a technology company and will only be a reference example in carrying out the pre-test given. Of course there must be a more perfect answer.

- In this pretest you are free to use any language. Can be Json, Sql, Python. However, this minicase is using full python.
- free to use any database to upload CSV files (1 million rows of dummy data)
- Mandatory! for answer questions 2 and 3

First, Read the 'Pre_test.pdf' file !!
